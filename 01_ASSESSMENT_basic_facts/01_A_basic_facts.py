    1+1! which is not 11 or window but 2!!
    2+2! which is not fish but 4!!
    3x3! which is not 6 but 9!!

# Generate two random numbers first.
# Put the two random numbers into a simple math equation,

# Avoid errors such as division by zero.


# if user gets question right celebrate if user gets question wrong add to bad score list and say

# then continue program / quiz
