# set and code random math questions that HAVE RIGHT ANSWERS and do not involve decimal places
# (IMPORTANT!!!!!!)
# HOW TF DO I DO THIS !!!!


# like this guide I found online that goes like this:
# Generate two random numbers first.
# Put the two random numbers into a simple math equation,
# which can be addition, subtraction, multiplication or division. Calculate the equation and verify user input.
# Avoid errors such as division by zero.


# if user gets question right celebrate if user gets question wrong add to bad score list and say
# "you got it wrong, never in my fifteen years of being a computer program have I seen an answer this wrong"
# then continue program / quiz
